      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Dråfølin, a {{ age }} year old computer science student from Switzerland.
        I've used to be a self-taught programmer, but I then officially started studying computer science to get a
        degree.
      </p>

      <h2>Computer science</h2>
      <p>
        I'm mostly interested in web development, but I also like to dabble in other areas of programming, like
        scripting to automate annoying and repetitive tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the web development part, I have some full-stack experience. For the backend, I've worked with Node.js
        and
        Express, and for the frontend, I've worked with React and Vue.js. I've also worked with databases, like
        MySQL and Postgres.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the scripting part, I've worked with Go and Bash, and made multiple scripts, such as one for filling
        my
        work log automatically, one for installing my preferred applications on a new system, and one for killing
        useless
        heavy processes when I run resource-intensive tasks.
      </p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>

      <p>
        My work is also kind of a hobby for me. I love making stuff that ends up either useful or nice-looking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides work, I absolutely love dragons, so much that I ended up making myself an Original Character based on
        Wings of Fire's NightWings. Through this OC, I became part of the Furry Fandom, and found lots of people who
        had the same centers of interest I did.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also like reading, playing games and watching videos. Hey, I'm still a regular guy!
